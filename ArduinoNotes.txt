1. When gain is increased getting invalid SOF when setting calibration and reading temp.
	- Gain increase produces a measurable distance increase in inventory and getCalibration()
	- Gain values are noted in the writeARCBGain() and in the datasheet for AMS tag.
	
	
2. Need to do more temperature tests, but seemed to be withing a few degrees of actual
	when using setCalibration().
	
3. Haven't finished implementing writing the data to file and deciding on which data 
	structure to use for time and temperature data. Need to collaborate with Dean.
